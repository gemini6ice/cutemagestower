	<h2>A Completely Normal Variety Cryptic with No Shenanigans Solution (no really this time)</h2>
	<h3>by Jen McTeague (with location help from Julia Tenney)</h3>
	
	<p>Welp, it looks like we accidentally printed the solution instead of the actual cryptic. Sorry. Those cryptic clues were so good too!</p>

	<p>Well, at least solvers could do the variety section, even if they got more information than intended.</p>

	<h3>Section 1: Substrings</h3>
	<p>This deals with the carving of a lion on the T Station Platform. 7 entries contain the substring LEO with a letter in the middle. Pull these letters out.</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety1.png"></div>

	<h3>Section 2: Color Phrases</h3>
	<p>This deals with (HEY JULIA, WHAT IS THIS NOW?). 8 of the entries can have the word GREEN put in front of them to make a new phrase.</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety2.png"></div>

	<h3>Section 3: Unchecked Letters</h3>
	<p>This section involved the Sarma Octopus Mural. 8 of the rows/columns have exactly 8 unchecked letters. Taking the first letter of the first row in row/column order, second of the second row/column, etc, gives you 8 letters for the final message.</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety3.png"></div>

	<h3>Section 4: Crossing Letters</h3>
	<p>This section involves the carving on Somerville High School. Those carvings use the letter V for U, and so do 8 entries in this crossword. Find the 8 entries, and then do the indicated shifts on the grid to get the appropriate letters.</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety4.png"></div>

	<h3>Section 5: Books</h3>
	<p>The jigsaws never materialized. It was probably faster to look them up online anyway. Sorry. The relevant books are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Holes - SACHAR</li>
		<li>Amelia Bedelia- PARISH</li>
		<li>A Wrinkle in Time- LENGLE</li>
		<li>The Snowy Day - KEATS</li>
		<li>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie - NUMEROFF</li>
		<li>Everyone Poops - GOMI</li>
		<li>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day - VIORST</li>
	</ul>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety5.png"></div>

	<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
	<p>When the grid is completely together, it looks like this:</p>
	<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="imgvariety6.png"></div>
	<p>The grid looks like a mess, much like the end of any variety cryptic, but the message on the side says THE SOULS JOURNEY AS A SERIES OF WEIRD OLD CARS.</p>
	<p>This is a public art piece in Cambridge - a painting of a bunch of cars on stairs. When you go to that location, there are a number of street signs in front of it. Ignore the ones written in green, as mentioned in the author's note, and the remaining one gives the answer <b>NO PARKING</b>.</p>
