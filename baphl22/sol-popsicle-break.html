	<h2>Popsicle Solution</h2>
	<h3>by Ata Gurpinar</h3>
	
	<p>This is a metapuzzle and uses the answers to the puzzles in this round.</p>

	<table class="solutiontable">
		<tr><th>Puzzle</th><th>Solution</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Chess & Ladders</td><td class="answer spoiler">TOO MANY ROOKS</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Grateful Undead</td><td class="answer spoiler">THANK YOU NECKS</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Many of Them</td><td class="answer spoiler">A JACK OF ALL TIRADES</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Quintuple Jeopardy</td><td class="answer spoiler">AXOLOTL QUESTIONS</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>The words in the pieces of popsicle sticks in the tree and on the ground can be used to fill in the question marks on the popsicle sticks at the bottom of the page to form riddles with the puzzle answers as reasonable punchlines.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A JACK OF ALL TIRADES: Without mastery of specific skillsets, what playing card hosts a podcast to rant about potentially contentious topics?</li>
		<li>AXOLOTL QUESTION: In order to solve murder mysteries underneath Mexico City, what should an amphibious private investigator do?</li>
		<li>THANK YOU NECKS: When she visited the zoo, what did Ariana Grande shout at the giraffes?</li>
		<li>TOO MANY ROOKS: Known for lengthy opening credits, what television show doesn't have any kings?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At this point, the solver should notice that the length of each puzzle answer (in letters) is equal to its riddle (in words). In order of the popsicle stick pieces in the tree, each corresponding letter can be read as follows:</p>
