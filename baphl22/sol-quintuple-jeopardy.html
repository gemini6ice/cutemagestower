	<h2>Quintuple Jeopardy Solution</h2>
	<h3>by Ata Gurpinar and Julia Tenney</h3>
	
	<p>Each of the responses can be a question to one of the clues if the ? is replaced with one of who/what/where/when/why and the 5 is replaced with a five-letter word. Solvers can use the fact that the clues are in alphabetical order by the word that replaces the 5 to help solve the last couple clues.</p>
