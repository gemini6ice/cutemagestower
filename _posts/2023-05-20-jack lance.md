Jack Lance died on May 1st, 2023. He was an absolutely brilliant man with an uncanny ability to just pull out puzzles from nowhere. I look up to him and admire him and he was taken from us too soon.


I wrote a riddle. It wasn’t meant to be a tribute riddle - it’s not really about Jack itself - but I cannot deny the effect that he had on me while writing it. While I have solved lots of letter webs before, I was always really intimidated by doing the coding and the connections. I have lots of great riddle ideas, but creating letter webs was always a weak point in my skills. But his RT3 Search reminded me that letter webs don’t necessarily need to follow the ridiculousness of riddle letter webs - sometimes a plain-stock web can still have wonderful solving moments.

So I made this letter web. It is a plain-stock web about an event that we both enjoyed - the Harvard Riddle Search. While it’s not actually a tribute to Jack - I’m sure that he’s looking down and smiling at what he’s inspired. This was super fun and I’m sure that you’ll see more letter webs out of me - maybe even with more shenanigans.

List of clues (because I am bad at coding and don’t know how to make the clues wrap):

* 2023: This theme was about adventures in computer technology and where it would lead us, although it also shed light on human-ai relations.
* 2022: A campus building disappeared and hunters had to travel to a library-adjacent place that contains all of the appropriate media.
* 2021: A professor on campus created something brand-new, but this item is causing problems and people are bouncing around trying to fix it.
* 2020: This theme was about taking something old and revamping it so that everyone could enjoy it. The US currency reference helped.
* 2019: This was the 100th anniversary of The Great Molasses Flood. The theme involved molasses flooding a place where, if the walls came down, the residents would fight each other.
* 2018: This theme was about an animated movie that personifies things within the body. These things help the body with a particular struggle.
* 2017: This theme was about a fantasy role-playing game.
* 2016: This theme (which was blatantly stolen from a previous BAPHL) was about a piece of media where someone traveling in a constructed reality could go places previously thought impossible.
* 2015: This theme had solvers building a special ship and then traveling to a place few humans have gone before.
